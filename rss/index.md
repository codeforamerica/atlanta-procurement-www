### **What is RSS?**
Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a way to have information automatically pushed to you from the web. Instead of needing to visit a website to get updates, RSS makes it possible for updates to come to you. RSS saves time by automatically notifying you when there are updates to some piece of content on the web such as the Department of Procurement website. You receive notifications by subscribing to the updates of various sites using an RSS feed reader.

### **Why is this useful?**
Subscribing to a Department of Procurement RSS feed saves you time because you will no longer need to repeatedly check the Department of Procurement website for RFP updates. Additionally, you are also free to subscribe to the updates of only the departments that interest you.
<br><br>

### **Where can I get an RSS feed reader?**
To read the updates in an RSS feed, you need a reader, also known as an aggregator. RSS feed readers can be web-based, part of your email software, or installed on your computer or smartphone. Web-based readers enable you to get your updates on any computer.

Sometimes your feed may appear empty. This happens when there are no recent Department of Procurement updates.
