<br /><h2>DIVISION 3. APPEALS AND REMEDIES</h2>
<br /><h3>Sec. 2-1161. Authority to resolve protested solicitations and awards.</h3>
<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <em>Right to protest.</em> Any actual offeror that has
submitted a bid/proposal for a particular procurement and is aggrieved in connection with the
solicitation or award of the contract shall protest
in writing to the chief procurement officer after
the date that the specific bid or proposal is submitted. No protest will be accepted or considered
prior to the date the specific bid or proposal is
submitted; it will be considered untimely. All
protests shall set forth in full detail the factual
and legal bases for the protest and specific relief
sought by the protestor. Protests arising from
factual or legal bases that the protestor knew or
should have known prior to the submission of the bid/proposal must be submitted within three days
of the submission of the bid/proposal. Protests
arising from factual or legal bases that the protestor knew or should have known subsequent to
the date the bid/proposal was submitted must be
submitted within ten days after the protestor
knew or should have known of such bases, but in
no event shall any protest be submitted more
than ten days after the award of the contract.
Untimely protests will not be considered by the
chief procurement officer and will be simply denied as untimely.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Posting of protest security.</em> Any actual offeror submitting a written bid/proposal that files
a protest must, at the time of filing, post security
in the amount of one percent of the financial offer
of the protestor or, in the event the bid/proposal
does not involve a fixed financial offer either in
the form of payment of monies to the city or
payment of monies to the offeror, $100,000, to be
tendered in the form of a bond or certified check.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Application of protest security.</em> If the chief
procurement officer denies the protest, he/she
shall assess against the protestor reasonable attorneys' fees and other administrative costs incurred by the city in reviewing and responding to
the protest. If the city is represented by its law
department, such fees and costs will be calculated
at the hourly rate of each attorney participating
in the review and response to the protest set forth
in each attorney's most recent city paycheck times
the number of hours worked by such participating
attorneys on the protest, or if Georgia Law permits a greater hourly rate, such greater rate, plus
all out of pocket costs of the city concerning the
protest. If the city is represented by outside
counsel, such fees and costs will be calculated at
the billing rates of the firm's attorneys participat-
ing in the review and response to the protest,
times the number of hours worked by such participating attorneys, plus all out of pocket costs of
the firm concerning the protest. Within 15 days of
denying the protest, the chief procurement officer,
in consultation with the city's law department
and outside counsel, if any, will calculate the city's
cost in reviewing and responding to the protest
and will apply the protester's bond or certified
check to such costs. Any remaining balance of the
bond or certified check will be returned to the protestor; provided, however, if the protester files
an appeal of the city's denial of its protest pursu-
ant to code section 2-1166, such certified check or
bond will continue to be retained by the city to
cover the costs of the city associated with such
appeal.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Decision on protest.</em> If a protest is timely
filed, the chief procurement officer shall inform
the protestor of the decision in writing within ten
days or, if the chief procurement officer requires
more than ten days to render a decision, will
advise the protestor within the initial ten days of
the additional amount of time required to render
a decision on the protest.
    </li>
    <li><em>Finality of decision.</em> A decision under sub-section (d) of this section is final and conclusive,
unless fraudulent or the protestor, having the
right to file under this division, files an administrative appeal with the procurement appeals hearing officer in accordance with this division.

<br /><h3>Sec. 2-1162. Debarment or suspension from
consideration for contract
award.</h3>
<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <em>Authority to debar or suspend.</em> The chief
    procurement officer, after consulting with the city
    attorney, is authorized to debar a person for cause
    from participation in any city procurements at
    any tier and consideration for award of contracts.
    The debarment shall be for a period of not more
    than five years. The period of time during which
    the debarment will be imposed is to be determined by the chief procurement officer based
    upon the severity of the causes for debarment.
    After consultation with the using agency and city
    attorney, the chief procurement officer is authorized to suspend a person from participation in
    any city procurement at any tier and consideration for award of contracts if there is probable
    cause for debarment. The suspension shall not be
    for a period exceeding the greater of: (1) three
    months; (2) the period during which administrative review of the suspension is pending; or (3) the
    period during which judicial review of an administrative decision that was adverse to the suspended firm is pending.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Causes for debarment or suspension.</em> The causes for debarment or suspension include:
      <ol>
        <li>Conviction for commission of a criminal offense as an incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract or in the performance of such contract or subcontract.</li>
        <li>Conviction under state and federal statutes of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records,
receiving stolen property or any other
offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty which currently,
seriously and directly affects responsibility as a city contractor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conviction under state or federal anti-trust statutes arising out of the solicitation and submission of bids or proposals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Violation of contract provisions, as set
forth below, of a character which is re-
garded by the chief procurement officer to
be so serious as to justify debarment ac-
tion:     <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Deliberate failure to perform in accordancewith the provisions orwithin
the time limit provided in any city
contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              A recent record of failure to perform
or of unsatisfactory performance in
accordance with the terms of one or
more contracts, provided that failure
to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the
control of the contractor shall not be
considered to be a basis for debarment. In the event that the contractor asserts in a city suspension or
debarment proceeding that such recent failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance in accordance with
the terms of one or more contracts
was caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor, the contractor
must introduce documentation from
the applicable contract/project in
which it provided notice of such acts
beyond its control and/or invoked its
rights to equitable adjustment or other similar remedies under the
applicable contract as a result of
forcemajeure or other similar events;
provided, however, that the city's
determination on such issue will be
independent fromthe contract/project
at issue. It is insufficient in a city
debarment proceeding for the con-
tractor to raise this issue for the first
time concerning a prior contract under which it failed to perform or
performed unsatisfactorily.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Violation of the ethical standards set forth
in division 13 of this article.
        </li>
        <li>
          Submission to the city of a claim for
additional compensation that is without
merit, including, but not limited to claims
seeking to recoup:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Costs incurred by the contractor but
not included in its bid or proposal
due to its own error;</li>
            <li>
              Costs that it has already been paid or will be paid under the contract;
            </li>
            <li>
              Costs asserted simply for the purpose of forcing the city to consider a settlement at a reduced amount;
            </li>
            <li>
              Costs that the contractor has not certified pursuant to the contract documents; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Costs that the contractor would not
be entitled to recover under the contract documents, including, but not
limited to attorneys fees and interest on unpaid sums.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Knowing misrepresentation to the city of
the use which a majority-owned contractor intends to make of a minority and
female business enterprise (a business
entity at least 51 percent of which is
owned and controlled by one or more
African Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Hispanic Americans, or females, or
a combination thereof, as defined in section 2-1443 and certified as such by the
city), as a subcontractor, member of a mentor-protégé relationship, or a joint
venture partner, in performing work un-
der a contract with the city.
        </li>
        <li>
          Material misrepresentation of the composition of the ownership or work force of a
business entity certified to the city as a
minority and female business enterprise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any other cause the chief procurement
officer, in consultation with the using
agency and city attorney, determines to be
so serious and compelling as to affect
responsibility, including, but not limited
to, debarment by another governmental
entity.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Notice.</em> The chief procurement officer shall
issue a written notice of the decision to debar or
suspend. The notice shall state the reasons for the
action taken and the effective date of the debarment or suspension and shall inform the debarred
or suspended person involved of the right to
administrative review as provided in this division.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Finality of decision.</em> A decision under subsection (c) of this section is final and conclusive,
unless fraudulent or any person adversely affected by the decision appeals administratively to the procurement appeals hearing officer in accordance with this division.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>City council initiated debarment.</em> The city's
council, by enactment of an appropriate resolution, may request that the chief procurement
officer initiate an investigation into whether a
particular person should be debarred and/or suspended and, after consulting with the city attorney, the chief procurement officer is authorized to
debar or suspend such person for cause from
participation in any city procurements at any tier
and consideration for award of contracts.

<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <em>Applicability.</em> This section applies where it
is determined by administrative review that a
solicitation or award of a contract is in violation of
applicable law. For purposes of this section administrative review shall refer to a review by the chief procurement officer, in consultation with the
city attorney, or a review by an appropriate procurement or office of contract compliance hearing
officer. A determination by the chief procurement
officer may be made independently and as a
result of the chief procurement officer receiving a
decision from an appeals officer that a solicitation
or award of a contract is in violation of applicable
law.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Remedies prior to award.</em> If, prior to award,
the chief procurement officer, after consultation
with the city attorney, determines that a solicitation or proposed award of a contract is in violation
of law, the solicitation or proposed award shall be
canceled or revised to comply with the law.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Remedies after award.</em> If, after an award,
the chief procurement officer, after consultation
with the city attorney, determines that a solicitation or award of a contract is in violation of
applicable law, then:
      <ol>
        <li>If the person awarded the contract has not acted fraudulently or in bad faith:</li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>The contract may be ratified and
affirmed, provided it is determined
that doing so is in the best interest of
the city; or</li>
          <li>
            If services or work have not commenced under the contract, it may
be terminated and the person
awarded the contract shall be compensated for the actual expenses rea-
sonably incurred in preparing to perform and in terminating its
performance under the contract, plus
a reasonable profit, prior to the termination; or
          </li>
          <li>
            If services or work have commenced
under the contract, it may be terminated and the person awarded the
contract shall be compensated for
the actual expenses reasonably incurred in preparing to perform and
in terminating its performance under the contract, plus a reasonable
profit, prior to the termination, less
any amount previously paid to it
under the contract.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      If the person awarded the contract has
acted fraudulently or in bad faith:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The contract may be declared null and void; or</li>
        <li>The contract may be ratified and
affirmed if such action is in the best
interests of the city, without prejudice to the city's right to such damages as may be appropriate.</li>

<br /><h3>Sec. 2-1166. Appeals.</h3>
<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <em>Time for filing notice of appeal.</em> For an
appeal before a procurement appeals hearing
officer under section 2-1165, the aggrieved person
shall file a notice of appeal with the chief procure-
ment officer with a copy to the head of the
applicable using agency and city attorney within
seven days of receipt of the notice of an adverse
action by the chief procurement officer concerning
the person's protest.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Notice of hearing date; hearing.</em> Upon re-
ceipt of the notice of appeal from the aggrieved
party by the chief procurement officer, the chief
procurement officer shall forward the notice to a
procurement appeals hearing officer within three
days of receipt of the notice. The duties of the
procurement appeals hearing officer shall be as
follows:
      <ol>
        <li>The procurement appeals hearing officer
shall set a hearing date not more than
seven days from the date of receipt of the
notice from the chief procurement officer.
The officer shall cause notice of the hear-
ing date, time and location to be served
upon all parties, by registered mail.</li>
        <li>
          At the hearing, all parties shall be pro-
vided a fair and impartial hearing and
shall be allowed to produce any and all
admissible evidence in either party's pos-
session concerning the appeal.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Decision.</em> The procurement appeals hearing
officer shall, within seven days of the hearing,
make a written decision on the appeal, which
decision shall affirm or deny the decision by the
chief procurement officer. The officer shall decide
whether:
      <ol>
        <li>The solicitation or award being appealed
was in accordance with applicable law
and the terms and conditions of the solic-
itation; or</li>
        <li>
          The debarment or suspension being appealed was in accordance with applicable law and in the
          best interest of the city and was fair.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Notice of decision.</em> The procurement ap-
peals hearing officer shall issue written notice of
the decision on the appeal to all parties within
seven days of the hearing. The notice of the
decision shall be sent to all parties by registered

decision.
    </li>
    <li>

filed, a protestor may not discontinue such appeal
without prejudice, except as authorized by a pro-
curement appeals hearing officer.

      Recovery of costs by the city. If at the
procurement appeals hearing, the city prevails,
the procurement appeals hearing officer shall
assess against the protestor reasonable attorneys'
fees and costs incurred by the city in preparing for
and attending the hearing. If the city is represented by its law department, for each attorney
participating in the appeal, such fees and costs
will be calculated at the hourly rate of pay as set
forth in each attorney's most recent city paycheck
multiplied by the number of hours worked by
such participating attorneys on the appeal, plus
all out of pocket costs of the city concerning the
appeal, such as copying costs, transcription fees,
litigation services fees, etc. If the city is represented by outside counsel at the hearing, such
fees and costs will be calculated at the billing
rates of the firm's attorneys participating in the
appeal, times the number of hours worked by
such participating attorneys, plus all out of pocket
costs of the firm concerning the appeal. If the
protestor appeals the decision of the procurement
appeals hearing officer to the superior court, the
city shall continue to hold the bond or certified
check of the protester pending the results of the
appeal to superior court. If the protester is unsuccessful in the superior court, the city shall deduct from the bond or certified check all of its costs
associated with its review and response to the
protest, its preparation for and attendance at the
procurement appeals hearing and its response to,
preparation for and attendance at any hearing
held in superior court concerning protest and
subsequent appeals. The city's costs in responding to, preparing for and attending any hearing in
the superior court will be calculated in the same
manner as its costs in preparing for and attending
a procurement appeals hearing.

based on the requirements set forth in the invita-
tion for bids and the City's Code of Ordinances.
Those criteria, including but not limited to dis-
counts, transportation costs and total or life-cycle

            <li>
              Withdrawal. In lieu of bid correction, a
low bidder alleging a material mistake of
fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid
if:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>The mistake is clearly evident on the
face of the bid document, but the
intended correct bid is not similarly
evident; or     </li>
                <li>
                  The bidder submits evidence that
clearly and convincingly demonstrates
that a mistake was made.

              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          All decisions to permit the correction or with-
drawal of bids shall be supported by a written
determination made by the chief procurement
officer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Tie bids.</em> If two or more offerors are tied in
price while otherwise meeting all of the required
conditions, the contract shall be awarded to an
offeror whose principal place of business is within
the city or, if not within the city, within the
metropolitan Atlanta area or, if not within the city
or metropolitan area, within the state. Where no
offeror is located within the state, the chief pro-
curement officer shall award the contract to the
offeror whose principal place of business is the
closest to the city.
      </li>
    <li>
      <em>Award.</em> The contract shall be awarded with
reasonable promptness by written notice to the
most responsible and responsive offeror whose bid
meets the requirements and criteria set forth in
the invitation for bids. In determining the most
responsible and responsive offeror, the chief pro-
curement officer, in consultation with the using
agency, shall consider the following:
      <ol>
        <li>The ability, capacity and skill of the of-
feror to perform the contract and provide
the services/supplies required;</li>
        <li>The capability of the offeror to perform
the contract and provide the services/
supplies promptly or within the time spec-
ified without delay or interference;
        </li>
        <li>The character, integrity, reputation, judg-
ment, experience and efficiency of the
offeror;</li>
        <li>The quality of performance of the offeror
of previous contracts and provision of ser-
vices/supplies;</li>
        <li>The previous and existing compliance by
the offeror with laws and ordinances re-
lating to the contract and provision of
services/supplies;</li>
        <li>The sufficiency of the financial resources
and ability of the offeror to perform the
contract and provide the services/sup-
plies;</li>
        <li>The compliance of the offeror with the
requirements of an equal employment op-
portunity in contracting program as may
be required by ordinance;</li>
        <li>When applicable, the compliance of the
offeror with the requirements of a minor-
ity and female business enterprise partic-
ipation program as may be required by
ordinance;</li>
        <li>The compliance of the offeror with the
requirements of a local preference pro-
gram as may be required by ordinance;</li>
        <li>The quality, availability and adaptability
of the supplies or services to the particu-
lar use required; and</li>
        <li>The price. If all bids exceed available
funds as certified by the chief financial
officer and the most responsible and re-
sponsive bid does not exceed such funds
by more than five percent, the chief pro-
curement officer is authorized, when time
or economic considerations preclude
resolicitation of a reduced scope, to nego-
tiate an adjustment of the bid price, in-
cluding changes in the bid requirements,
with the most responsible and responsive
offeror in order to bring the bid within the
amount of available funds.</li>

    <li>
      <em>Multi-step sealed bidding.</em> When it is con-
sidered impractical to initially prepare a pur-
chase description to support an award based on
price, an invitation for bidsmay be issued request-
ing the submission of unpriced offers to be fol-
lowed by an invitation for bids limited to those
offerors whose offers have been qualified under
the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Substitution, replacement by uncertified
minority business enterprise or female business
enterprise prohibited.</em> An offeror may not substi-
tute for or replace any minority business enter-
prise (MBE) or female business enterprise (FBE),
as those terms are defined in section 2-1443,
when that MBE or FBE has been designated in
writing by the offeror as a subcontractor for the
contract on which the offeror has submitted a bid,
if the MBE or FBE submitted as a part of the bid
is not a certified, legitimate MBE or FBE, as
determined by the office of contract compliance. If
the office of contract compliance determines that
the MBE or FBE is not legitimate or certified, the
bid of the contractor who submitted the bid shall
be rejected.
    </li>
    <li>
      The office of contract compliance shall eval-
uate each such bid as to the offeror's compliance
with subsections (k)(7) and (8) of this section and
shall notify the chief procurement officer, in writ-
ing, whether the bid is responsive or nonrespon-
sive.

<br /><h3>Sec. 2-1188.1. Local preference.</h3>
<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li><em>Applicability.</em> This local preference pro-
gram shall only apply to any city contract (re-
ferred to hereinafter as "Eligible local projects")
procured under section 2-1188 competitive sealed
bidding. It does not apply to procurements utiliz-
ing competitive sealed proposals under section
2-1189, small purchases under section 2-1190,
sole source procurement under section 2-1191,
emergency procurement under section 2-1192,
competitive selection procedures for professional
and consultant services under section 2-1193 and
federally-funded projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Statement of policy.</em> The city has a signifi-
cant interest in encouraging the creation of em-
ployment opportunities for its residents and for businesses located within the city. As a purchaser
of goods and services, the city will benefit from
expanded job and business opportunities for its
residents and businesses through additional rev-
enues generated by its activities. It is in the
interest of the city and its residents to give
preference on eligible local projects to those eligi-
ble offerors who have direct physical and eco-
nomic relationships with the city.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Certification as a local offeror.</em> In order to be
certified as a local offeror, an eligible offeror must
submit a completed application to the department
of procurement, and the applicant must be ap-
proved and certified by the department of procure-
ment. An eligible offeror must submit a completed
and signed written application to become a local
offeror before it will be allowed to receive a bid
preference on an eligible local project. In order to
be approved as a local offeror and receive a bid
preference on an eligible local project, the appli-
cation for approval as a local offeror and all
supporting documents must be received by the
department of procurement at least 30 days prior
to the date bids are received on such eligible local
project. An eligible offeror who fails to submit an
application for approval as a local offeror at least
30 days prior to the date bids are received on an
eligible local project, and who otherwise meets
the requirements for approval as a local offeror,
will not be qualified for a bid preference on such
eligible local project.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Criteria.</em> To be certified as a local offeror,
the eligible offeror must satisfy no less than two
of the following criteria:
      <ol>
        <li>The eligible offeror's principal place of
business is located in the city or that the
eligible offeror has held a valid city busi-
ness license for at least one year prior to
the date of application.</li>
        <li>
          A majority of the full time employees,
chief officers, and managers of the eligible
offeror have regularly conducted work and
business in the city for at least one year
prior to the date of application.
        </li>
        <li>
          A majority of the employees based at the
eligible offeror's location(s) in the city
have been residents of the city for at least
one year prior to the date of application.
        </li>
        <li>
          The services the eligible offeror offers to
the city have been provided by the eligible
offeror in the city for at least one year
prior to the date of application.
        </li>
      </ol> <!-- End certification criteria -->

      If the applicant is a joint venture or mentor-
protégé team, each participant in the joint ven-
ture or mentor-protégé team must be approved
independently as a local offeror in order for the
joint venture or mentor-protégé team to receive
the bid preference on eligible local projects.
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Term.</em> The certification as a local offeror
shall expire two years from the date of the ap-
proval of the application. Following the expiration
date, a business is no longer a local offeror. An
eligible offeror must submit a new application for
certification as a local offeror to the department of
procurement and establish that it continues to
meet the requirements contained in paragraph
(d) of this section in order to receive a bid prefer-
ence on eligible local projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Determining responsiveness of non-local offerors.</em> The geographic location of an eligible offeror shall be one of the factors considered by the
department of procurement in determining whether a bid on an eligible local project is responsive. A bid submitted by a non-local offeror shall be deemed non-responsive on the basis that the eligible offeror is a non-local offeror, unless:
      <ol>
        <li>For eligible local projects valued at less
than $500,000.00, the amount of the bid
submitted by the non-local offeror is ten
percent lower than the lowest responsible
and responsive bid submitted by a local
offeror;
        </li>
        <li>
          For eligible local projects valued at
$500,000.00 or more, the amount of the
bid submitted by the non-local offeror is
five percent lower than the lowest responsible and responsive bid submitted by a
local offeror;
        </li>
        <li>
          The bid submitted by the non-local offeror
would be responsible and responsive but
for the fact that the eligible offeror is a
non-local offeror; and
        </li>
        <li>
          The amount of the bid submitted by the
non-local offeror is lowest among bids
submitted by other non-local offerors that would be responsible and responsive but
for the fact that such other eligible of-
ferors are non-local offerors.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Continuing obligations of eligible offerors certified as local offerors.</em> Eligible offerors certified as local offerors shall be under a continuing
duty to immediately inform the department of procurement in writing of any changes in the eligible offeror's business if, as a result of such; changes, the eligible offeror no longer satisfies
the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <em>Conditions for use.</em> Under this article, when
the chief procurement officer determines that the
use of competitive sealed bidding is either not
practicable or not advantageous to the city, a
contract may be procured by the use of the com-
petitive sealed proposals method.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Request for proposals.</em> Proposals shall be
solicited through a request for proposals. Notice
of all such requests for proposals shall be for-
warded to all members of the finance/executive
committee.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Public notice.</em> When requested by the using
agency, the chief procurement officer shall issue
public notice for request for proposals from of-
ferors as provided in subsection 2-1188(c).
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Selection.</em> The chief procurement officer, in
consultation with and upon recommendation of
the head of the using agency, shall select from
among the offerors no less than three offerors
deemed to be the most responsible and respon-
sive; provided, however, that if three or less
offerors respond to the solicitation, this require-
ment will not apply. The selection shall be made
in order of preference. From the date proposals
are received by the chief procurement officer
through the date the contract is awarded, no
offeror may make substitutions, deletions, addi-
tions or other changes in the configuration or
structure of the offeror's teams or members of
offerors' teams. The selection criteria shall in-
clude, but not be limited to, those contained in
subsection 2-1188(k) and the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Previous experience demonstrating com-
petence to perform the services involved
in the solicitation;</li>
        <li>Past performance of previous contracts
with respect to time of completion and
quality of services;</li>
        <li>The fee or compensation demanded for
the services;</li>
        <li>The ability to comply with applicable laws;</li>
        <li>The ability to comply with the schedule
for the performance of the services, as
required by the city;</li>
        <li>The financial ability to furnish the necessary bonds;</li>
        <li>The financial condition of the offeror;</li>
        <li>The ability to provide staffing of manage-
ment personnel, satisfactory to the city;
and</li>
        <li>The offeror's compliance with the require-
ments of equal employment opportunity
(EEO) and, where applicable, equal busi-
ness opportunity (EBO) programs, as may
be required by ordinance.</li>
      </ol><!-- Selection criteria -->

      The office of contract compliance shall evaluate
each proposal as to the offeror's compliance with
the requirements of equal employment opportu-
nity (EEO) and, where applicable, equal business
opportunity (EBO) programs, as may be required
by ordinance. The office of contract compliance
shall evaluate each proponent's conformance to
the city's EEO-ordinance and the city's EBO or-
dinance according to relative weights assigned by
the chief procurement officer. The combinedweights
may not exceed 15 percent of the total evaluation
points.<br /><br />
    When applicable, each request for proposal
shall state with specificity the method by which
EEO and EBO compliance is weighted to arrive at
numerical evaluation points. Proposals that are
noncompliant with the city's EEO or EBO require-
ments shall be deemed nonresponsive without
further evaluation of any other solicitation eval-
uation factors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Evaluation factors.</em> The request for propos-
als shall state the relative importance of evalua-
tion factors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Discussion with responsible offerors and revisions to proposals.</em> Discussions may be conducted with responsible and responsive offerors
who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for
any purpose in the best interests of the city,
including the purpose of clarification to ensure
full understanding of and responsiveness to the
solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to
any opportunity for discussion and revision of
proposals, and such revisions may be permitted
after submissions and prior to award for the
purpose of obtaining the best and final offers. In
conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.
    </li>

    <li>
      Award. Award shall be made to the most
responsible and responsive offeror whose pro-
posal is determined in writing to be the most
advantageous to the city, taking into consider-
ation the evaluation factors set forth in the re-
quest for proposals, this section and in section
2-1188(k).

      General procedures. Any contract or pur-
chase order for supplies, services and construc-
tion not exceeding $20,000.00 may be made in
accordancewith small purchase procedures adopted

<br /><h3>Sec. 2-1191. Sole source procurement.</h3>
<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      Under this article, a contract or purchase
order for a supply service, construction item or
professional or consultant servicemay be awarded
without competition when the chief procurement
officer determines in writing, after conducting a
good-faith due diligence review of reasonable available sources, that are in the city's best interest,
there is only one source for the required supply,
service, construction item or professional or con-
sultant service. The due diligence review shall
include, but not be limited to, research of avail-
able sources and contact with professional and
trade associations related to the required supply,
service, construction item or professional or con-
sultant service. The determination in writing
shall also state the sources reviewed.
    </li>
    <li>
      The chief procurement officer shall conduct
negotiations as to the terms of the sole source
procurement. A record of sole source procure-
ments shall be maintained that lists each
contractor's name, the name and type of each
contract, the item(s) procured under each con-
tract and the identification number of each con-
tract file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Subsequent to the execution of a sole source
contract, the original sole source designee may
not assign the contract to any other entity or
individual unless the provisions of this subsection
are satisfied. If the original sole source designee
desires to assign the contract subsequent to its
execution, it must make a request for assignment
to the chief procurement officer and include with
that request information concerning the proposed
assignee. The chief procurement officer will re-
view such request and information (including any
additional information he/she may request) to
determine if the assignee independently meets
the sole source requirements of this section. If the
chief procurement officer finds that the assignee
meets the sole source requirements of this sec-
tion, council must approve such assignment be-
fore it may become effective.

<br /><h3>Sec. 2-1191.1. Special procurements.</h3>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this
code, the chief procurement officer may initiate a
procurement above the small purchase amount
specified in section 2-1190 where he/she deter-
mines that an unusual or unique situation exists
that make the application of all requirements of
competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed
proposals contrary to the public interest and such
procurement does not technically qualify as a sole source procurement under Code section 2-1191. If
determined as appropriate by the chief procure-
ment officer, any special procurement under this
section shall be made with such competition as is
practicable under the circumstances; provided
however, that the chief procurement officer may
determine under appropriate circumstances that
there is only one logical choice as to a contractor
to provide the goods or services necessitated by
the special procurement. A written determination
of the basis for the procurement and for the
selection of the particular contractor shall be
included by the chief procurement officer in the
contract file. Nothing in this section shall elimi-
nate the chief procurement officer's obligation to
present the recommendation of award of any
contract procured under this section to city coun-
cil for approval, prior to execution of the contract,
when the value of the contract exceeds $100,000.00.<br />

<br /><h3>Sec. 2-1192. Emergency procurement.</h3>
<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      When the chief procurement officer deter-
mines that an emergency exists, the chief procure-
ment officer may make or authorize others to
make emergency procurements for supplies, ser-
vices, construction items or professional or con-
sultant services. The chief procurement officer
shall make such determination when there exists
a threat to public health, welfare or safety under
emergency conditions. Such emergency procure-
ments shall be made with as much competition as
is practicable under the circumstances.
    </li>
    <li>
      A written determination of the basis for the
emergency and for the selection of the particular
contractor shall be included in the contract file.
As soon as practicable, a record of each emergency
procurement shall be made and shall set forth the
contractor's name, the amount and type of the
contract, a listing of the item procured under the
contract and the identification number of the
contract file.
    </li>
    <li>
      If an emergency should arise after office
hours which requires immediate action on the
part of the using agency involved for the protec-
tion of the city or if a like situation arises on a
Sunday or holiday and it is not possible or conve-
nient to reach the chief procurement officer, any purchase necessary may be made by the official in
charge of such using agency. The purchase shall
be reported to the chief procurement officer within
24 hours. When the mayor declares a state of
emergency and implements the Atlanta-Fulton
County Emergency and Disaster Operations Plan,
Annex 10A, additional supplies and equipment
needed shall be procured in accordance with the
plan, using the most practicable method which
will ensure both expeditious procurement and
effective control.

<br /><h3>Sec. 2-1193. Competitive selection procedures for professional and consultant services.</h3>
<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li><em>Conditions for use.</em> The chief procurement
officer, upon the request or recommendation of
the using agency, shall procure professional and
consultant services, in accordance with this sec-
tion, except as authorized under sections 2-1191
and 2-1192.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Statement of qualifications.</em> The chief pro-
curement officer shall request andmaintain state-
ments of interest from persons interested in pro-
viding professional and consultant services that
shall include a statement of qualifications and
performance data for such persons. Each using
agency shall encourage professional and consult-
ant firms, which desire to provide services to the
agency, to submit statements of qualifications to
the chief procurement officer. The chief procure-
ment officer may specify a uniform format for
statements of qualifications. Persons may amend
these statements at any time by filing a new
statement. Any person placed on the qualifica-
tions list shall be removed if found in violation of
any provision of this article, including, but not
limited to, division 11, 12 or 13, or if such person
is found in default under any contract with the
city.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Public notice.</em> When requested by the using
agency, the chief procurement officer shall issue
public notice for requests for proposals from pro-
fessional and consultant offerors as provided in
subsections 2-1188(c) and 2-1189(c).
    </li>
    <li>
      Selection. The chief procurement officer, in
consultation and upon the recommendation of the
head of the using agency, shall select from among
the offerors no less than three offerors (the "short-
listed offerors") deemed to be the most responsible
and responsive; provided, however, that if three
or less offerors respond to the solicitation, this
requirement will not apply. The selection of the
short-listed offerors shall be made in order of
preference. From the date proposals are received
by the chief procurement officer through the date
the contract is awarded, no offeror may make
substitutions, deletions, additions or other changes
in the configuration or structure of the offeror's
teams or members of offeror's teams prior to
award. The selection criteria shall include, but
not be limited to, those contained in subsection
2-1188 (k) and the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Previous experience demonstrating com-
petence to perform work or services in-
volved in the solicitation;</li>
        <li>Past performance of previous contracts
with respect to time of completion and
quality of work;</li>
        <li>The fee or compensation demanded for
the services;</li>
        <li>The ability to comply with applicable laws;</li>
        <li>The ability to comply with the schedule of
the commencement and completion of the
services, as required by the city;</li>
        <li>The financial ability to furnish the neces-
sary bonds;</li>
        <li>The financial condition of the offeror; and</li>
        <li>The ability to provide staffing of manage-
ment personnel, satisfactory to the city.</li>
        <li>The offeror's compliance with the require-
ments of equal employment opportunity
(EEO) and, where applicable, equal busi-
ness opportunity (EBO), as may be re-
quired by ordinance. As part of the selec-
tion process, the office of contract
compliance shall evaluate each proposal
as to the offeror's compliance with the
requirements of equal employment oppor-
tunity (EEO) and equal business opportu-
nity (EBO) programs as may be required by ordinance. The office of contract com-
pliance shall evaluate each proponent's
conformance to the city's EEO ordinance
and, where applicable, the city's EBO
ordinance according to relative weights
assigned by the chief procurement officer.
The combined weights may not exceed 15
percent of the total evaluation points.
Each request for proposal shall state with
specificity the method by which EEO and
EBO compliance is weighted to arrive at
numerical evaluation points. Proposals that
are noncompliant with the city's EEO or
EBO requirements, where applicable, shall
be deemed nonresponsive without further
evaluation of any other solicitation eval-
uation factors.</li>
      </ol> <!-- End selection criteria -->
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Negotiations and award.</em> The chief procure-
ment officer shall negotiate a contract with the
most responsible and responsive short-listed of-
feror at compensation that the chief procurement
officer determines in writing to be fair and rea-
sonable to the city. In making this decision, the
chief procurement officer shall take into account
the estimated value, the scope, the complexity
and the professional nature of the services to be
rendered. Should the chief procurement officer be
unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with
the offeror considered to be the most responsible
and responsive at a price for the chief procure-
ment officer determines to be fair and reasonable
to the city, negotiations with that offeror shall be
terminated. The chief procurement officer shall
then undertake negotiations with the secondmost
responsible and responsive short-listed offeror. If
negotiations with the second most responsible
and responsive short-listed offeror are unsuccess-
ful, negotiations shall be terminated and the chief
procurement officer shall then undertake negoti-
ations with the thirdmost responsible and respon-
sive short-listed offeror. Should the chief procure-
ment officer be unable to negotiate a contract
with any of the short-listed offerors, the chief
procurement officer and the using agency may
select from the additional offerors that were not
short-listed in order of their responsibility and
responsiveness and the chief procurement officer
may continue negotiations in accordance with
this section until an agreement is reached.
